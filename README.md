-

### Whish List: ###
* Add server-side Guns system: https://github.com/TheLouK/Urt-Source-Code/blob/master/guns42.c
```
        Check the SV_Check_Com_Printf & the added cvar "sv_Guns". This code was made for 4.2 but also, please take a look to the SV_Event_Kill_Guns cause i'm not 100% sure it will work fine with your mod :)
```
* Team config (Free/Blue/Red):
    * <strong>[COMPLETED]</strong> RegenStamina: like the RegenHealth but for stamina :D (it could behave like the 4.1 mod if possible: it starts to regen when the player is not in the air)
    * <strong>[COMPLETED]</strong> ForceWeapons & ForceItems: The player will spawn with these weapons.
* Hide "!pm " in chat: https://github.com/TheLouK/Urt-Source-Code/commit/88074d19603331be46943cc0542e024ea8483af8

##### Cvars: #####

##### Rcon Commands: #####
* <strong>[COMPLETED]</strong> spoof: Send a server command as a specific client.1/commits/3df483ae0ad8fea766afd3c357999bf9c2ff987d
* <strong>[COMPLETED]</strong> teleport or tp: no explanation needed x)
* <strong>[COMPLETED]</strong> setweapon or sw: remove all weapons except the given (would be wreat if we can set more than one).
* <strong>[COMPLETED]</strong> setitem or si: remove all items except the given (would be wreat if we can set more than one).
