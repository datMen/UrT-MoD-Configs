### Whish List:
* Add server-side Guns system: https://github.com/TheLouK/Urt-Source-Code/blob/master/guns42.c

        Check the SV_Check_Com_Printf & the added cvar "sv_Guns". This code was made for 4.2 but also, please take a look to the SV_Event_Kill_Guns cause i'm not 100% sure it will work fine with your mod :)

* Team config (Free/Blue/Red):
    * RegenStamina: like the RegenHealth but for stamina :D (it could behave like the 4.1 mod if possible: it starts to regen when the player is not in the air)
    * ForceWeapons & ForceItems: The player will spawn with these weapons. If you can, it would be great if we can add "ForceSettings":
    * ForceSettings:
        * <strong>+</strong> symbol: Allow the player to set his weapons/items, the weapon/item set after the "+" will be ADDED to his "inventory" (just if the player doesn't have it).
        * <strong>-</strong> symbol: Allow the player to set his weapons/items, the weapon/item set after the "-" will be REMOVED from his "inventory" (if the player have it).
        * <strong>@</strong> symbol: A reference to all weapons (your current "-").

                Force Example:

                    ForceWeapons: +14, -6 // Give Sr8 and remove UMP5K

                    ForceGear: 19, -@ // Give medkit and remove the rest of items

* Hide "!pm " in chat: https://github.com/TheLouK/Urt-Source-Code/commit/88074d19603331be46943cc0542e024ea8483af8
